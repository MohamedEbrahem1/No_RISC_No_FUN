<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->


## About The Project

This project focuses on designing and implementing a single-cycle RV32I CPU, a highly efficient computing unit where each instruction is executed in precisely one clock cycle (CPI=1). The core of this project is the realization of a subset of the RISC-V instruction set, specifically tailored to the RV32I architecture. The CPU is to be implemented on an Artix-7 FPGA, using the Basys3 board.
